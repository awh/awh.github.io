I've recently been watching various video lectures on functional programming and both of these contained responses to audience questions regarding the contribution of functional programming languages to the success of their respective endeavours:

* [Caml Trading](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKcOkWzj0_s) - Yaron Minksy, Jane Street Capital
* [Running a startup on Haskell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR3Jirqk6W8) - Bryan O'Sullivan (of [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org) fame)

In both cases the speakers acknowledged what I suppose is an obvious truth: anyone who is interested in functional programming is likely to be so because they are extremely concerned with correctness, and therefore likely to produce quality code in any paradigm. Consequently it is difficult to objectively appraise the contribution of the functional paradigm to a successful project!
